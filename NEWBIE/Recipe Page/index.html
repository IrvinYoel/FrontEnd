          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
          <li>
            Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>
            <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch
            of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
            tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat the pan:</strong>Place a non-stick frying pan over
            medium heat and add butter or oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong>Once the butter is melted and
            bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
            coat the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong>When the eggs begin to set
            at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
            your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fold and serve:</strong>As the omelette continues to cook,
            carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
            for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enjoy:</strong>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if
            needed.
          </li>
