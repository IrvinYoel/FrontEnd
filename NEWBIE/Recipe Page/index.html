          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a
              pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
              tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heat the pan:</strong>Place a non-stick frying pan over
              medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong>Once the butter is melted and
              bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
              coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong>When the eggs begin to
              set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle,
              sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fold and serve:</strong>As the omelette continues to cook,
              carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
              for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enjoy:</strong>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper
              if needed.
